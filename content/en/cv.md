# César Ballardin

**Senior Software Developer · System Architect · Educator | Energy Grid & Power Systems | Vue.js · TypeScript · Python · GNU/Linux**

Argentina

## Summary

I'm a generalizing specialist -- someone who can go deep on system architecture, software development, or infrastructure, and connect the dots across all three. With 35+ years in the field, I've built software, managed servers, taught at universities, and shipped products across the energy, government, and education sectors.

Currently at NewGrid, I develop software that helps grid operators identify reconfigurations to route power around congested transmission facilities, reducing operational costs and improving reliability. NewGrid's transmission topology optimization technology leverages redundancy in grid networks to relieve congestion bottlenecks and maintain reliability during emergency conditions.

What sets me apart is the combination of deep GNU/Linux infrastructure roots with modern frontend development and two decades of university teaching. I've administered networks and servers at scale, automated provisioning with Ansible and Python, and taught programming paradigms (Smalltalk, Scheme, Prolog), artificial intelligence, and operating systems design at multiple universities. Teaching sharpens how I think about code -- clarity, correctness, and the ability to explain complex systems are habits, not afterthoughts.

My technical range spans frontend (Vue.js, TypeScript, Vite), backend (Python, Flask, SQL, PostgreSQL), infrastructure (GNU/Linux, Ansible, networking, firewalls), and past work with C, Ruby, PHP, and Smalltalk. I've worked in the energy sector since 1989 -- from SCADA software selection at a provincial power utility to grid optimization software today.
