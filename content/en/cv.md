## Basic Info

I work as a senior software developer, system architect, and technical educator. This role draws on more than 35 years of experience across software development, infrastructure engineering, and university teaching. The result is:

- Comprehensive understanding of the full technology stack, from frontend applications through backend services to underlying infrastructure
- Practical ability to design, build, automate, and maintain production systems end-to-end
- Capacity to communicate complex technical concepts with clarity -- refined through two decades of university instruction

## Benefits from this experience include:

- Purpose-built internal tools that translate intricate domain workflows into effective, usable software
- Automated, reproducible infrastructure that accelerates provisioning and eliminates configuration drift
- Robust GNU/Linux server and network environments, seamlessly integrated with heterogeneous systems
- Thorough documentation and structured knowledge transfer -- teams gain autonomy, not dependency
