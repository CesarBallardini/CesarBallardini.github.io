## About

I'm a generalizing specialist -- someone who can go deep on system architecture, software development, or infrastructure, and connect the dots across all three. With 35+ years in the field, I've built software, managed servers, taught at universities, and delivered solutions across the energy, government, and education sectors.

I help organizations solve complex technical challenges by combining modern software development with deep infrastructure expertise. Whether it's building an internal platform, automating server provisioning, integrating GNU/Linux and Windows environments, or training your technical team -- I deliver working solutions with clarity and reliability.

## Services

- **Custom Software Development** -- Frontend applications in Vue.js and TypeScript, backend services in Python and Flask, data visualizations, and database solutions with PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure & Automation** -- GNU/Linux administration, Infrastructure as Code with Ansible and Terraform, virtualization with QEMU/libvirt/Vagrant, cloud deployments on AWS and Digital Ocean, DevOps practices
- **System Integration** -- Integration between GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows server environments, email systems, security, and vertical business applications
- **Technical Training** -- GNU/Linux system administration, performance analysis, programming paradigms, and AI fundamentals -- delivered on-site for your technical teams
- **Energy Sector Expertise** -- Working in the energy industry since 1989, from SCADA software at a provincial power utility to grid optimization software today

## Why work with me
